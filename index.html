      <p class="explanation"> Google's Android and Apple's iOS are operating
        systems used primarily in mobile technology, such as smartphones and
        tablets. Android, which is Linux-based and partly open source, is more
        PC-like than iOS, in that its interface and basic features are generally
        more customizable from top to bottom. However, iOS' uniform design
        elements are sometimes seen as being more user-friendly. You should
        choose your smartphone and tablet systems carefully, as switching from
        iOS to Android or vice versa will require you to buy apps again in the
        Google Play or Apple App Store. Android is now the world’s most commonly
        used smartphone platform and is used by many different phone
        manufacturers. iOS is only used on Apple devices, such as the iPhone. </p>
